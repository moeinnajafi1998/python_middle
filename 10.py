# difference between function and method in python

# In Python, the terms "function" and "method" are related but have distinct meanings based on how they are used and where they are defined.
# Function:
# •	Definition: A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def keyword followed by a name, parentheses (), and optionally parameters.
# •	Invocation: Functions are typically called by using their name followed by parentheses containing any arguments (if required).
# •	Scope: Functions can be defined at the global level or within other functions or classes.
# •	Arguments: They can accept parameters (both positional and keyword arguments) which are specified within the parentheses in the function definition.
# •	Example:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # Calling the function add_numbers
print(result)  # Output: 8

# Method:
# •	Definition: A method in Python is similar to a function but is associated with an object or class. It is defined within a class and is used to define the behavior of an object.
# •	Invocation: Methods are called on objects using the dot notation (object.method()), where object is an instance of a class that defines the method.
# •	Scope: Methods are bound to objects and are typically defined within a class definition.
# •	Arguments: Like functions, methods can also accept parameters, including the self parameter which refers to the instance of the class.
# •	Example:
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self, x):
        return x * 2

obj = MyClass()
result = obj.my_method(4)  # Calling the method my_method on obj
print(result)  # Output: 8

# Key Differences:
# 1.	Definition Context: Functions are standalone blocks of code, whereas methods are defined within the scope of a class and are associated with objects of that class.
# 2.	Invocation: Functions are called independently by their name, while methods are invoked on specific instances of a class using the dot notation.
# 3.	Use with Classes: Functions can be used with or without classes, while methods are specific to classes and their instances.
# 4.	self Parameter: Methods in Python classes have an implicit first parameter named self, which refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called. This parameter is not explicitly present in functions.
# In summary, while both functions and methods serve the purpose of executing code, methods are specifically tied to classes and instances of those classes, providing a way to define behaviors and actions that objects can perform.
