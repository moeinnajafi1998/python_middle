# what is lambda in python

# In Python, lambda is a keyword used to create small anonymous functions. These functions are often referred to as lambda functions or lambda expressions. 
# Lambda functions are a way to define functions inline and are typically used for short functions that are disposable or used only once.
# Syntax:
# The syntax for a lambda function is:

# lambda arguments: expression
# •	lambda: Keyword that marks the beginning of the lambda function definition.
# •	arguments: Comma-separated list of parameters (similar to a regular function).
# •	:: Separates the parameter list from the expression.
# •	expression: Single expression whose result is implicitly returned as the result of the lambda function.
# Example Usage:
# Here's a simple example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

# In this example:
# •	lambda x, y: x + y defines a lambda function that takes two arguments x and y, and returns their sum.
# •	add is a variable that references this lambda function.
# •	add(3, 5) calls the lambda function with arguments 3 and 5, resulting in 8.
# Characteristics and Usage:
# 1.	Anonymous: Lambda functions are anonymous because they do not require a name like regular functions defined with def.
# 2.	Single Expression: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression, which is evaluated and returned. This limitation makes them suitable for short, simple operations.
# 3.	Functional Programming: Lambda functions are often used in functional programming contexts where functions are treated as first-class citizens (i.e., functions can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values from other functions).
# 4.	Conciseness: Lambda functions are concise and can make code more readable when the function logic is straightforward and not too complex.
# Use Cases:
# Lambda functions are commonly used in situations where a simple function is needed temporarily, for example:
# •	Sorting: As a key function in sorting operations (sorted(), sort()).
# •	Mapping and Filtering: In functional programming operations like map() and filter().
# •	Event Handlers: As callbacks in event-driven programming.
# •	Mathematical and Statistical Operations: For quick calculations and transformations.
# Limitations:
# Lambda functions have limitations compared to regular functions defined with def:
# •	They can only contain a single expression.
# •	They are less readable for complex logic.
# •	They cannot include statements (like return, pass, assert, etc.).
# Due to these limitations, lambda functions are best suited for simple operations where brevity and convenience are more important than extensive logic and readability.
